# REST API Practice.
A practice/example for myself of RESTful API within Rails, using simplified API version of Rails setup. Includes TDD workflow using RSpec, FactoryBot, Faker and Shoulda Matchers.

Check [Requests Spec](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/REST_API/tree/master/spec/requests) for test specifications using RSpec.  
Check [Controllers](https://github.com/yayorbitgum/REST_API/tree/master/app/controllers) for examples of the API design.
